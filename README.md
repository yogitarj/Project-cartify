Problem Statement 
 
Challenges in E-Commerce 
In the realm of online shopping, consumers often encounter several challenges that hinder their 
overall experience. These challenges include: 
 
1. Limited Product Diversity: Many e-commerce platforms offer a restricted range of 
products, forcing consumers to browse multiple websites to find their desired items. 
2. Complex User Interfaces: Some online marketplaces have cluttered and unintuitive 
designs, making navigation, product discovery, and the checkout process frustrating for 
users. 
3. Security Concerns: With the rising number of cyber threats, consumers hesitate to share 
sensitive payment information on platforms that lack robust security measures. 
4. Inefficient Order and Inventory Management: Many platforms struggle with real-time 
order tracking and efficient stock management, leading to delays and poor customer 
satisfaction. 
5. Limited Regional Accessibility: Several e-commerce websites operate only within 
specific regions, restricting their reach and excluding potential customers. 
 
The Cartify project aims to overcome these challenges by developing a comprehensive and user
centric e-commerce platform. Through an intuitive shopping experience, secure transactions, 
real-time order tracking, and a powerful admin panel, Cartify seeks to revolutionize the way 
consumers and sellers interact within the online marketplace.

System Analysis 
 
System analysis is a crucial phase in the development of the Cartify platform, involving the study 
of existing e-commerce models, understanding stakeholder requirements, and evaluating the scope 
and limitations of the project. This phase forms the foundation for designing and implementing a 
scalable, user-friendly, and efficient online marketplace. 
 
Existing System 
 
Currently, many e-commerce platforms face challenges that hinder the shopping experience for 
both customers and administrators. Cartify aims to address these gaps and offer an enhanced 
solution. 
Key Characteristics of the Existing E-commerce System: 
1. Fragmented Product Management: Many e-commerce sites lack efficient product 
catalog management, making it difficult to maintain inventory and update product listings 
dynamically. 
2. Complex User Experience: Some platforms have cluttered interfaces that make 
navigation, search, and checkout processes cumbersome. 
3. Limited Administrative Control: Many platforms provide basic admin functionalities, 
making it hard to monitor users, manage orders, and analyze performance effectively. 
4. Security and Payment Issues: Cybersecurity risks and payment gateway limitations can 
create trust issues among customers. 
 
Challenges in the Existing System: 
 
1. Scalability Issues: Many e-commerce platforms struggle to handle large inventories, 
high traffic, and vendor management efficiently. 
2. Lack of Seamless Admin Controls: Traditional platforms do not offer a centralized 
admin panel to manage users, products, vendors, and orders in real time. 
3. Security Risks: Insufficient protection of user data, payment transactions, and admin 
controls can lead to vulnerabilities. 
  Cartify

4. Limited Customization & User Engagement: Many platforms fail to provide 
personalized recommendations, seamless filtering, and interactive shopping 
experiences. 
 
While the existing system of Cartify has served its purpose, there is a clear need for adaptation and 
evolution to meet the changing demands of the market. Transitioning to an online platform can 
address many of the challenges posed by the current system, offering enhanced accessibility, 
scalability, and convenience for customers while positioning Cartify for continued success in the 
digital age.

Scope and Limitations of Existing System 
 
Scope: 
The existing system of Cartify operates as a physical ecommerce retail store, serving a 
localized customer base. Key aspects include: 
1. Local Market Presence – Cartify primarily caters to customers within its 
geographical vicinity, offering ecommerce products and services to a specific 
community. 
2. In-Person Shopping Experience – Customers can physically browse through 
merchandise, interact with products, and make informed purchase decisions. 
3. Personalized Assistance – Store staff provide real-time assistance, product 
recommendations, and guidance tailored to individual customer needs. 
4. Tangible Product Evaluation – Customers have the advantage of inspecting and 
trying on products before making a purchase, reducing uncertainty and return rates. 
 
Limitations: 
 
Despite its benefits, the existing system faces several challenges and constraints: 
 
1. Geographical Constraints – The store's reach is limited to customers who can visit in 
person, excluding potential buyers from other locations. 
2. Restricted Operating Hours – Shopping is confined to fixed business hours, which 
may not always align with customer schedules. 
3. Physical Space Limitations – The store has limited capacity for displaying and storing 
products, which may restrict variety and inventory size. 
4. High Operational Costs – Maintaining a physical storefront incurs expenses such as 
rent, utilities, and staff wages, affecting profitability and scalability. 
5. Lack of 24/7 Accessibility – Unlike online platforms, the store does not provide round
the-clock shopping, reducing convenience for customers. 
 
  Cartify

While the current brick-and-mortar model offers a personalized and tactile shopping experience, 
it lacks scalability, accessibility, and flexibility. To overcome these limitations, Cartify must 
transition to an online platform, ensuring wider customer reach, improved convenience, and 
sustainable business growth.
